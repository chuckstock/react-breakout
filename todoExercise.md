# Sign up for [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)
Once you create an account you will have an app dashboard where you can view connected apps.

# Exploring app.jsx
  We need to require both React, [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), and [ReactFire](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/react/).

# createClass()
We will pass an object to the createClass method. One of the most important keys to include in the object is render, which we will create a function as its value. The render function will contain a combination of basic HTML and other components we will build in React.
